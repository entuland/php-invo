# Inventory
A php-powered custom inventory management system.

This repository is here only for illustrative purposes. It has been created several years ago, practically from scratch, based on specific requirements of a customer, then altered and patched on site to arrange for the customer's usage needs.

Even though it _may_ be installed and run you would most likely be better with some other solution which you can get support for - this repo may get updates in the future but I will not guarantee any support about it.

All of this code has been slightly mangled in order to be published here and I did my best to have it somewhat working, but I'm extremely confident that there are several bugs hanging here and there.

Nonetheless, if you know what you're doing and you're ready to deal with what all of this is about, you're free to use / fork / modify it as you please, it's your decision :)

This repo includes a [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file with a crash course on setting it up along with some usage examples and about fifty screenshots.
